# JSinSA

A super-scrappy few fixes for the JS in SA site.

Lots of the problems come from [the template](http://bootstraplovers.com/templates/codeon-v3.2/demo-default.html).

There are lots of things I did not do:

* optimisation of *all* images;
* swapping of font awesome icons for SVGs;
* optimising and minifying HTML;
* server-side stuff like caching and the header image rotation;
* concatenating CSS files;
* chopping out of unused CSS;
* lots of other things probably.
